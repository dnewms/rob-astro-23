_"_We are thrilled to become part of the ACM family of journals,” explained _THRI_ Co-Editor-in-Chief Odest Chadwicke Jenkins of the University of Michigan. “ACM’s reputation as a publisher of computing research is unparalleled. At the same time, the broad representation of computing disciplines in the ACM, the organization’s global reach, and platforms such as the Digital Library, are a perfect complement to our own goals for _THRI_.

Jenkins, along with Co-Editor-in-Chief Selma Šabanović of Indiana University, have set three primary goals for the journal in the coming years, including: 1) Sustaining the intellectual growth of HRI as a field of study (both quantitatively and qualitatively), 2) Enabling timely and productive feedback from readers, and 3) Cultivating new and leading-edge ideas in both robotics and the human-centered sciences

The inaugural issue of the rebranded _ACM Transactions on Human-Robot Interaction (THRI)_ is planned for March 2018. Those seeking to submit for the publication, or who have questions for the editors, are encouraged to visit the current [HRI Journal website](http://humanrobotinteraction.org/journal-introduction/).
