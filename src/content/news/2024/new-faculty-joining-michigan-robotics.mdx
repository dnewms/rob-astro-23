The Robotics Department at the University of Michigan thrives on the principle that collaboration multiplies the quality and impact of our work, and we’re excited to announce new faculty who each bring their own teaching and research expertise to the program.

Faculty joining us this year and next include:

- Bernadette Bucher

- Steven Ceron

- Xiaoxiao Du

- Yulun Tian

Read more about each below.

## Bernadette Bucher

Bernadette Bucher joins Michigan Robotics this fall as an Assistant Professor with research in the intersection of computer vision, machine learning, and robotics. Bucher is working on learning interpretable visual representations and estimating their uncertainty for use in downstream science and robotics tasks with a particular interest in enabling robust and inquisitive autonomous mobile manipulation in novel and dynamic environments. Bucher earned a PhD in computer science in the GRASP lab at University of Pennsylvania, and previously worked as a research scientist at the Boston Dynamics AI Institute and as a senior software engineer at Lockheed Martin Corporation.
