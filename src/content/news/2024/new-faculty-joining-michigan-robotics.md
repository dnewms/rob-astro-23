## Bernadette Bucher

Bernadette Bucher joins Michigan Robotics this fall as an Assistant Professor with research in the intersection of computer vision, machine learning, and robotics. Bucher is working on learning interpretable visual representations and estimating their uncertainty for use in downstream science and robotics tasks with a particular interest in enabling robust and inquisitive autonomous mobile manipulation in novel and dynamic environments. Bucher earned a PhD in computer science in the GRASP lab at University of Pennsylvania, and previously worked as a research scientist at the Boston Dynamics AI Institute and as a senior software engineer at Lockheed Martin Corporation.

[VLFM: Vision-Language Frontier Maps for Zero-Shot Semantic Navigation](http://naoki.io/portfolio/vlfm.html)

## Steven Ceron

Steven Ceron will join Michigan Robotics as an Assistant Professor in January 2025 to work on research problems related to swarm robotics, including micron-scale robot swarms. Ceron earned a PhD in mechanical engineering at Cornell, and is currently a Distinguished Postdoctoral Fellow at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

## Xiaoxiao Du

Xiaoxiao Du will now be a Lecturer in Robotics this fall, in addition to working as an Assistant Research Scientist. Du previously lectured in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Du’s research has focused on machine learning and computer vision for sensor data, which has been applied to predicting pedestrian movement, autonomous driving, remote sensing, and precision agriculture.
