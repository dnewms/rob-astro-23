With the [new Robotics Department](https://2024.robotics.umich.edu/2021/first-robotics-department/ "The first robotics department among top 10 engineering schools") and [undergraduate robotics program](https://2024.robotics.umich.edu/2022/new-u-m-undergraduate-robotics-program/ "New U-M Undergraduate Robotics Program launches") launched, we have brought on additional faculty who exemplify our [values](https://2024.robotics.umich.edu/about/values/ "Values"). These new members will help us meet our goals of training the next generation of roboticists and advancing robotics research in order to positively impact the quality of people's lives.
