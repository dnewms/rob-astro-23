  **Abstract**

  The early 1980's, when I was a student at the University of Michigan, was the time that industrial robots for material handling, assembly, and inspection were becoming well established in product manufacturing environments. Robotic capabilities have continued to develop and expand into the products themselves, made possible as the enabling technologies have become "retail market mature" in their performance, cost-effectiveness, and reliability. Consumer products apply these technologies to enhance their customer-facing capabilities using robotics technologyâ€¦ and transportation products are no exception.

  Automobiles have become more technologically advanced and feature-laden, particularly in the areas of active safety systems and varying levels of autonomous operation. In each case the vehicle itself takes over or augments safety-critical tasks that the driver was fully responsible for previously. This has pulled robotics engineering to intersect with the world of automotive product engineering. Both are highly interdisciplinary and require broad thinking to pull it all together as a retail consumer product. Deep technical specialization is also required in critical areas along the engineering supply chain.

  In this talk I will share my education and career path in the automotive industry, similarities between automotive and robotics engineering, and how today's robotics engineering education can apply to this industry. I will also discuss some of the skills and behaviors that employers are looking for that we are not directly taught in school. We will also have time for Q&A at the end.

  **Bio**

  Andrew J. Farah, most recently the Executive Director of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) at General Motors, has stepped back from his 36-year career with the automaker in September 2023. He has held various leadership positions in Engineering, Planning, and Aftersales. He plans to continue in the industry to advise leaders and businesses, while also focusing on developing the engineering talent that the industry needs today and tomorrow.

  With over 40 years of total automotive technical and business experience, Mr. Farah has had the opportunity to work on and lead many groundbreaking vehicle programs. He made major contributions to the EV1 electric vehicle as Engineering Manager for Propulsion Software & Controls, the Chevrolet Volt extended-range electric vehicle as Vehicle Chief Engineer, and the Cruise AV and Cruise Origin as vehicle Chief Technical Architect and program Executive Director. He has also been involved in the automotive launch of several electrical/electronic technologies that are now considered commonplace in the industry. In his most recent ADAS role he was responsible for the development and execution of active safety features, Super Cruise, and Ultra Cruise for GM's retail and fleet portfolio.

  Mr. Farah holds a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering (BSE CE '82) and a master's degree in Electrical Science (MSE '84), both from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. He is also a member of the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE).

  **Abstract**

  How does someone who wanted to be an environmentalist as a high schooler end up dissecting frogs for a PhD in Robotics and then get a type of job he didn't even know existed? In exploring this story, we will unpack (a) how a chance encounter got me into biorobotics, (b) how thinking of robotics as a human endeavor as opposed to a base of knowledge helped me land a PhD position and make award-nominated contributions to biology, and lastly (c) how a combination of soul searching and connecting with people helped me get unstuck after my PhD and land a job I didn't even know existed. Ultimately, I hope learning of my journey gives you encouragement to follow your curiosity, hope that things will turn out okay, and some practical tools to soul search if you're stuck in that process.

  **Bio**

  Dr. Laksh Kumar Punith is a Research Investigator in the Neurobionics Lab at the University of Michigan's Robotics Department. He holds a B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering from the National Institute of Technology Karnataka ('15), and a Ph.D. in Robotics from Georgia Institute of Technology ('22). As a roboticist, Dr. Punith has been fascinated by how animals move so much better than any robots we've ever built - all while having hardware that should make their job much harder - namely, slower communication (i.e. neurons), state-dependent actuators (i.e. muscles) and squishy transmission (i.e. tendons). To solve this conundrum, he (1) develops hypotheses of how animals move from comparative biomechanics literature and experiments in the lab and (2) directly tests them by attempting to generate movement in mathematical models and organic robots. He hopes this approach will not only shed light on the basic science of animal locomotion, but also serve as an accelerant to build better organic and inorganic robots.

  Robots are the key to exploring our Solar System and beyond. For decades, we've sent robotic spacecraft to our planetary neighbors and other bodies to understand essential scientific questions: How did the planets come to be? Is there or has there been life elsewhere? What else is out there? In this talk, I will speak about the next step in understanding one of our nearest neighbors, Mars, through a multi-spacecraft, multi-robot mission to return martian samples back to Earth for the first time ever. I will be discussing how we go about tackling such a massive engineering challenge, how I learned the skills to do so at Michigan, and how you can too.
