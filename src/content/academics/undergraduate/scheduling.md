This page contains advice for students at different points in their undergraduate career. More detailed information can be found in the [Robotics Undergraduate Program Guide](http://robotics.umich.edu/undergrad-guide "draft Robotics Undergraduate Program Guide").

ROB 101 for First Year engineering students

We have reserved 210 seats in ROB 101 for incoming First Year Engineering students. First Year students should register in the following lab sections (you are automatically enrolled in the appropriate lecture section when you register for the lab): 

**In Person:** ROB 101 - 012

**Remote:** ROB 101 - 883

These sections are exactly the same—same instructor, meeting times, locations, etc—as sections 011 (in person) and 882 (remote) except that all seats are reserved for First Year Engineering students. If you are NOT a First Year Engineering student, please join the waitlist for one of the other sections of ROB 101. Once first year students have a chance to register, we will admit as many other students as we can to fill the class! ROB 101 is offered in fall and winter terms.

For more information on ROB 101 please see the course [webpage](https://robotics.umich.edu/academic-program/courses/course-offerings/rob101-fall-2022/).

Advice for Fall 24 Year 1 Students thinking about a Major in Robotics

- Meet with an Undergraduate Advisor through the [Engineering Advising Center](https://advising.engin.umich.edu/)

- Consider ROB 101 in F-24. We also plan to offer ROB 101 in WN-25.

- Consider ROB 102 as a means to meet your ENGR 101 requirement

- Be aware that there is a section of ENGR 100 called [Robotics Mechanisms](https://adue.engin.umich.edu/eng-100-information-for-students/)

Advice for Fall 24 Year 2 Students thinking about a Major in Robotics

Let’s assume you have completed ENGR 101 or ROB 102, ENGR 100, Calc I and Calc II, and PHYSICS 140.

Our suggestions are: 

- Plan on ROB 204 for W-25

- Over F-24 and W-25 semesters,
    - Complete one of (IOE 265, BIOMEDE 241, EECS 301) 
    
    - Complete one of (MECHENG 240, BIOMEDE 231) . Note that MATH 216 (or equivalent) is required for MECHENG 240.
    
    - Complete one of (EECS 215, BIOMEDE 211, EECS 270). Note that MATH 216 (or equivalent) is required for EECS 215 and BIOMEDE 211.
    
    - Complete EECS 280
    
    - Complete one of (ROB 101, MATH 214, MATH, 217, MATH 417, MATH 419)

- This will set you up for all of our 300-level classes. Of course, you are not required to take all of them, only three in fact. Hence, by studying the prerequisites more closely, you can be prepared for a subset of the 300-level courses, but not all of them.

Advice for Fall 24 Year 3 Students who are wondering if they can complete a Robotics Major

[Schedule an advising appointment](https://myadvising.lsa.umich.edu/appointments/offices/ROB) with Robotics to discuss your degree plan. If you can’t find an available appointment that fits in your schedule, please email robotics-sso@umich.edu to inquire about additional times.

For many students, it will be difficult to complete the undergraduate program in a total of 4 years with a switch in majors at this time point, but the Robotics degree could be completed with additional term(s) depending on previous course credits. It may be more appropriate to be targeting an MS degree in Robotics.

Before attending office hours, please review the [Undergraduate Program Guide](http://robotics.umich.edu/undergrad-guide). It would be helpful to bring along a list of the requirements and prerequisites that you’ve already met with your previous coursework. Please also note that while in startup mode, the Undergraduate Committee will consider individual students' petitions to waive certain prerequisites.  

Math Advice for Year 1 and Year 2 students planning to major in Robotics

ROB 298 Calculus for the Modern Engineer will be running its second pilot semester in W2025. The course is likely to become ROB 201 in F2025. The course does for Calculus what ROB 101 did for Linear Algebra: use programming to place the ideas in a rich engineering context. You can learn more [here](https://grizzle.robotics.umich.edu/education/rob201.html). Course is recommended for second-semester Year 1 students.

## Advising

You can [schedule an advising appointment with Robotics here](https://myadvising.lsa.umich.edu/appointments/offices/ROB) to discuss things such as major exploration, course planning, degree requirements and progress, career opportunities, and declaring a major.

**Drop-In Advising**

Undergraduate students only, Fall and Winter terms only

Robotics Undergraduate Academic and Faculty Advisors offer virtual drop-in advising appointments for ROB students who have quick questions. The goal for each drop-in appointment is 10-15 mins per appointment. Students may opt into using these appointments to discuss short-term course planning, graduation requirements, general advising, etc with one of ROB’s Academic Advising. 

Drop-In Advising Winter 2024 Schedule:

Tuesdays in April (4/2 4/9, 4/16, 4/23) from 10:00am-12:00pm

Please note: Drop-In advising will not be available during the week of Spring Break (February 26th-March 1st). Winter Drop-in Advising will conclude on Friday, April 23rd, for the semester.

[Join the Drop-in Advising queue Link](https://officehours.it.umich.edu/queue/1398)

_For students looking to receive career planning advising, ROB Faculty members will be available on select days._ 

### Petitions

A student may request special permission for an exception to the Robotics degree requirements or guidelines for a specific reason or circumstances through our [Robotics Undergraduate Program - Petition for Exception Request Form](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://deptapps.engin.umich.edu/petition/student/form?dept%3D210308&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1731449761916349&usg=AOvVaw3j2QlmdU32fEf2uy-yyoju). It is recommended that the student consult with an academic advisor, the undergraduate coordinator, and/or the [Robotics Undergraduate Q&A Forum](http://piazza.com/umich/winter2022/roboticsugqa) before submitting the petition.

Petitions for late adds/withdrawals, reinstatement, retroactive term withdrawal, and exceptions to college rules can be found on the [Engineering Center for Academic Success website](https://ecas.engin.umich.edu/ssc/petitions/).

## Sample & Editable Schedules

These sample schedules provide four different pathways in mind for a Robotics Major to help students envision how requirements may fit together over their time at Michigan. Each plan is only a sample of what is possible.

In addition to the sample schedules below, [an editable Robotics schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TJlbxRgqN-CUQzcEMHj9r_YzORPVk6ElG63vBJYi2Ms/edit#gid=0) is provided by the Engineering Advising Center for you to fill in as you plan your studies.

Computing-focused pathway

Hardware-focused pathway

Empiricism-focused pathway

Breadth-focused pathway
