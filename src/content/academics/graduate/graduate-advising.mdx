Let us help you answer your questions about the Robotics graduate program. While you wait for assistance, make sure to see the [Robotics Graduate Program Manual](https://robotics.umich.edu/academics/graduate/degree-requirements/), as it contains more detailed information about the Robotics graduate program.

If your question does not need a meeting, then you can email your question to [robotics-sso@umich.edu](mailto:robotics-sso@umich.edu).

## Graduate Program Coordinator

University of Michigan - Ann Arbor students interested in learning about the Master's and PhD programs, and current Robotics Master's and PhD students, are able to make an advising appointment with the Robotics Graduate Coordinator Denise Edmund.

You can schedule an advising appointment with the graduate coordinator to discuss topics such as:
- Degree requirements and progress
- Navigating policies
- Referral to resources

We recommend connecting with your advisor at least once a semester for a degree audit and discussing your remaining degree requirements.

### Departmental Petitions

A Robotics undergraduate student may request an exception to the Robotics degree requirements or guidelines for a specific reason or circumstances through our petition system [here](https://forms.gle/YOUR-PETITION-FORM-LINK).

It is recommended that the student first consult with an academic advisor to determine if a petition is appropriate and what supporting materials could be necessary. Some common materials include:
- Syllabus for a course you wish to use towards a requirement
- Transcripts
- Email from instructor

Students should submit a petition before acting on the reason for the petition.

**Instructions for completing the online petition form:**
1. Select the "Type of Petition" that best describes your request.
2. Provide a description of the exception request.  
   _Example: "I wish to request an exception to use a transfer credit: Math 201X, to count as Math 215."_
3. Write a succinct but thorough rationale for the exception.
   _Example: "I studied abroad in the Summer of 20XX and took a course called Multivariable Calculus at the University of _______. The Math department determined that this course was missing certain topics required for Math 215. I have covered these topics in Math 4XX at the University of Michigan."_
4. Attach any supporting documentation such as course syllabi or transfer credit evaluations.

After submission, the Robotics Graduate Coordinator will review the petition in consultation with the Graduate Chair. You will be notified via email when a final decision has been made. Processing time may take up to 3-4 weeks; expedited requests should be discussed with your advisor.


## Robotics Graduate Student Council

The [Robotics Graduate Student Council](/academics/student-services/robotics-graduate-student-council/) is the student-run organization that holds outreach, social, educational, and professional events, which any Robotics graduate student can join.
