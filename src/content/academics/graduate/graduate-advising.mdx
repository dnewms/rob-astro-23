This page contains advice for current and incoming Robotics graduate students. More detailed information can be found in the [Robotics Graduate Program Manual](https://robotics.umich.edu/academics/graduate/degree-requirements/).

If your question does not need a meeting, then you can email your question to [robotics-sso@umich.edu](mailto:robotics-sso@umich.edu).

## Graduate Program Coordinator

University of Michigan - Ann Arbor students interested in learning about the Master's and PhD programs, and current Robotics Master's and PhD students, are able to make an advising appointment with the Robotics Graduate Coordinator Denise Edmund.

[Make an appointment with Denise here](https://calendar.app.google/uFV6eMYYFYdC6tA8A).

Please reach out via email anytime (robotics-sso@umich.edu).

## Advising Appointments

You can schedule an advising appointment with the graduate coordinator [here](#) to discuss topics such as:
- Degree requirements and progress

### Nick JÃ¤nne

**Peer Advisor**

Nick is a 2nd-year PhD student in Robotics, researching how robots can improve their scope of capabilities in the real world by learning from humans. He also hopes to one day build human habitats on the Moon and Mars using a team of robots and humans. Nick received his Bachelors of Computer Engineering degree from the University of Michigan in 2023, and has a passion for reading and writing on the next generation of artificial intelligence.

Nick is available on Wednesdays 3:00-5:00PM and Thursdays 1:00-3:00PM in the 2rd Floor Collaboration Space.

## Petitions

### Departmental Petitions

A Robotics undergraduate student may request an exception to the Robotics degree requirements or guidelines for a specific reason or circumstances through our petition system [here](#).

It is recommended that the student first consult with an academic advisor to determine if a petition is appropriate and what supporting materials could be necessary. Some common materials include:
- Syllabus for a course you wish to use towards a requirement
- Transcripts
- Email from instructor

Students should submit a petition before acting on the reason for the petition.

**Instructions for completing the online petition form:**
1. Select the "Type of Petition" that best describes your request.
2. Provide a description of the exception request.  
   _Example: "I wish to request an exception to use a transfer credit: Math 201X, to count as Math 215."_
3. Write a succinct but thorough rationale for the exception.
   _Example: "I studied abroad in the Summer of 20XX and took a course called Multivariable Calculus at the University of _______. The Math department determined that this course was missing certain topics required for Math 215. I have covered these topics in Math 4XX at the University of Michigan."_
4. Attach any supporting documentation such as course syllabi or transfer credit evaluations.

After submission, the Robotics Graduate Coordinator will review the petition in consultation with the Graduate Chair. You will be notified via email when a final decision has been made. Processing time may take up to 3-4 weeks; expedited requests should be discussed with your advisor.

## Additional Resources for Graduate Students

The Robotics Graduate Student Council is the student-run organization that holds outreach, social, educational, and professional events, which any Robotics graduate student can join.
