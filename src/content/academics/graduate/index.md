The Michigan Robotics graduate program consists of three main technical areas, which converge as students produce functioning robots:

- **Sensing** of the environment, external agents, and internal body information to determine state information

- **Reasoning** with that information to make decisions for guidance, control, and localization

- **Acting** upon the body and environment to produce motion or other outputs that enable the robot to locomote or interact with the environment

Each of these areas may be considered a subplan for coursework and research study.

Our students come to the field with a variety of backgrounds, particularly in mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and computer science. They learn to work in teams to accomplish the many tasks necessary to build and operate an autonomous system, including mechanical design, electronics, programming and integrating all the parts. Students graduate the program as independent researchers and engineers, and many will go on to [become leaders in robotics research](https://robotics.umich.edu/people/alumni/), in academia, industry and government.

## Admissions

The graduate program has application deadlines through the winter, and notifies applicants about decisions in the spring.
