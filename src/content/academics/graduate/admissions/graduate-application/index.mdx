## Frequently Asked Questions

<Accordion title="How are tuition and fees determined?">
Tuition and fees are established by the University Michigan Board of Regents annually.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How much is the tuition to attend Robotics graduate program?">
The [Office of the Registrar](http://www.ro.umich.edu/tuition/) provides the tuition rates for a current academic year. The Rackham Graduate School has additional tuition information on their [Cost of Attendance for Graduate Students web page](https://rackham.umich.edu/admissions/considering-grad-school/cost-of-attendance/). The [Office of Financial Aid](https://finaid.umich.edu/) also has information relating to the cost to attend the University of Michigan.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can Robotics review my application before I pay the application fee to let me know if I am admissible?">
The application fee must be paid before an application will be processed or reviewed by the Graduate Admission Committee. We do not provide an early review of a resume to see if an applicant should apply or not. We ask applicants who are interested in applying to our program, to apply and submit all application materials.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I have a bachelor's degree and I am thinking of obtaining a Ph.D., but I'm not sure. Should I apply to the Master's or Doctoral programs?">
If you are not sure, you should apply for the Master's program, but you should definitely express your Ph.D. interest on the application. If your long-term interests are to obtain a Ph.D., then we encourage applicants to apply directly to the Doctoral program. This allows you to work more efficiently towards candidacy. If you are not admitted to the Doctoral program, the Graduate Admissions Committee will automatically consider you for the Master's program when they are reviewing the application, as long as you do not already have a relevant Master's degree.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I apply to the Ph.D. program with just a Bachelor's degree?">
Yes you can. You would be considered a Direct Ph.D. student. This means if you are admitted to the Ph.D. program, you would earn your Master's degree along the way to obtaining your Ph.D.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="If my GPA or GRE scores are low, will I have a chance of being admitted to the program?">
Application materials undergo a comprehensive review by the Robotics Graduate Admissions Committee. The committee is a group of faculty that review all applications submitted; they determine how many students will be admitted to the program and provide recommendations for admission.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is the amount for the enrollment deposit?">
The Robotics graduate program does _not_ require an applicant to submit an enrollment deposit.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is the deadline date when I need to have all my application materials submitted by? Or is this just for the online application to be submitted?">
Applicants are asked to adhere to the application deadline for the application and supporting documents. However, we understand that there might be a delay in the receipt of letters of recommendation, test scores or transcripts to arrive. Receiving application materials after the deadline may result in a delay of the items being processed and reviewed by the Graduate Admission Committee. We ask that all applicants submit all required application materials by the deadline.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I received my degree and graduated from the Rackham Graduate School. Would I be considered a Change of Program student? How much would my application fee be?">
