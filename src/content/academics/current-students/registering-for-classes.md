Please note that when a course is dropped after the deadline, a "W" notation appears on the student's transcript indicating that the student elected the course and later dropped it (even if the student never attended the class).

## Waitlist

If you cannot get into course, your best option is get on the waitlist and see if you are enrolled into the course when a student withdraws. Waitlists remain active on Wolverine Access until the drop/add deadline for that term. We do not know your chances of getting into the course.

At the instructor's discretion, course permissions can be issued to students. You can ask for permission to enroll in the course after the first day of class. We recommend that you do not contact the instructor for a course permission before the first day of class because you may not receive it.

Course permission will come in an email. To use a course permission, students must first drop from the waitlist, and then add the class.

The Proposal Form should be submitted by the drop/add deadline of the term in which the student will be registered for ROB 590/690. This form must be completed by MS students and by PhD students at their advisor’s request. Once the student submits the form it will be sent to the advisor and to the graduate chair for their records. The advisor will then communicate with the student directly to approve or modify the form. We encourage both the student and the advisor to periodically revisit this agreement. It should be used by both the student and the research advisor to evaluate progress during the semester.

## Visit/audit a course

Before starting the process to visit/audit a course please read Section 3.2 of [Rackham's Academic Policies](https://rackham.umich.edu/academic-policies/section3/).

Please note that a course elected as Visit/Audit does not count toward degree requirements nor does it count toward full-time enrollment.

Once you are registered for the course, contact the instructor via email (and cc robotics-sso@umich.edu) asking for approval to visit/audit. Ask the instructor to reply to all with approval. Please include your UMID on the email. The Robotics SSO will forward the email to the Registrar's Office who will then change the grading basis. Please allow 2-3 business days for this to be processed by the Robotics SSO.
