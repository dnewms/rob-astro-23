Autonomous vehicles (AVs) will improve the safety of humans and help protect the environment, reducing crashes, congestion, and emissions. But autonomous systems can swim or fly as well as drive. Behavioral planning is one of the biggest issues that Michigan researchers deal with in developing such vehicles. How does an AV or a robot decide what to do and how to do it? Robots don't understand the intentions of the people around them. Neither do they understand how to behave in a way that helps the people around them understand the robots' intentions. 

Michigan attacks this challenge by developing safe systems that can perceive and track the actions of the people around them. This is a new area of robotics. Traditionally, roboticists determined what they wanted their machines to do, and then computed the lowest-energy way to do it. The presence of people in the robot environment hadn't entered the equation in a major way. Nevertheless, people have their own goals, interests, and levels of safety and comfort when encountering robots that the latter need to account for.
